          For lifelong learners, Events fuel curiosity and enrich lives by
          exposing them to diverse topics, cultures, and ideas. Each Event holds
          unique value because it caters to different needs, aspirations, and
          stages of life. From science and technology to arts and humanities,
          every Event builds bridges between theory and practice, helping
          learners apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. Power of
          choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
          what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
          avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
          or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures
          have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
          always holds in these matters to this principle of selection.

          Professional experience is a cornerstone of career development and
          personal growth. It encompasses the knowledge, skills, and expertise
          gained through working in specific roles, industries, or projects over
          time. Unlike theoretical learning, professional experience provides
          hands-on exposure to real-world challenges, fostering problem-solving
          skills, adaptability, and the ability to apply knowledge in practical
          settings. Through professional experience, individuals gain a deeper
          understanding of workplace dynamics, such as teamwork, communication,
          and leadership. It helps build technical competencies while nurturing
          soft skills like time management, decision-making, and conflict
          resolution, which are crucial for success in any field.
